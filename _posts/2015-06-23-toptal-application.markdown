From an early age, I was always fascinated by computers and eletronic games. I remember as a child's fascination with the _atari_, _genesis_, _super nintendos_ and _arcades_. I discovered at that time, in an _XT_ with _Basic_, how machines could be programmed to do amazing things. These are the oldest memories that made me work with computing.

I lived my whole life in São Paulo, a huge city of over _11 million_ people, counting the metropolitan area are more than _20 million_ people. It is a bustling city, diverse, with exciting nightlife, excellent restaurants and culture, but it is also chaotic, violent and heavy traffic. Since I had not lived in a different city - attended the University of São Paulo, and thus did not need to move to another city to go to college - I realized for the first time after 35 years, a different way of living when I moved to a much smaller city, Limeira.

Limeira is a city with about 400,000 people, is located less than 200 km away from Sao Paulo. I came to this city invited by a friend to lead a development team struggling to meet the growing demand by customers; to enhance the quality of the code to increase the speed of the team in the long term. Living in a smaller town is nice, I soon began to appreciate the things like having time for lunch at home, doing things with less hurry and have more free time. With my departure from the company I found myself at a crossroads: return to chaotic life at São Paulo, or try a different experience in different places? Seeking freedom to work anywhere I decided to apply to Toptal.
